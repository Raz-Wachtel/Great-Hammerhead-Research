    "Great Hammerhead (GHH) sharks are long lived, large, semi-pelagic elasmobranchs. When studied and sampled for research purposes, morphometric measurements are taken, usually including lengths, mass, sex, and chemical (stable isotope or toxicant) analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships between ontogeny and toxicants are vital for toxilogical studies in large fauna. While lengths can be easily documented, aging large elasmobranchs proves to be more of an estimation; aging is difficult to do without proper instrumentation and usually requires vertebrae sections with bomb radiocarbon analysis for validation.\n",

Code provided assumes that your local dataset contains the following morphometric values: Total Length (cm) or Fork Length (cm), Sex (Male, Female)."
